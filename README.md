## Avalanche prediction_SARIMA
## Description:
In the realm of avalanche detection and monitoring, a groundbreaking synergy of cutting-edge sensor technology and sophisticated machine learning, notably the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model, has emerged. This remarkable fusion not only discerns the lurking threats of snow avalanches but also renders them visible through an exceptionally intuitive software application. Within this application, danger zones are thoughtfully categorized with a visually intuitive color-coded system. Here, the cautious yellow, the reassuring green, and the ominous red, vividly articulate degrees of peril. This technological stride represents a pivotal advancement, an indispensable facet in the quest to heighten safety and preparedness within regions susceptible to avalanches.
It holds the potential to safeguard lives and valuable assets in the face of this formidable natural force.
